        <p>
        StockMonitor is a browser extension for Chrome and Edge that allows users to track stock prices in real time. <br>
        After installing the extension, users can add their favorite stocks to the watchlist. <br>
        The extension automatically fetches updated price information every minute from Yahoo.com. <br>
        <br>
        Users can track up to three stocks for free. To track more than three stocks, <br>
        they can upgrade to a subscription of $2 per month, which unlocks unlimited stock tracking.<br>
        When a user attempts to add more than three stocks, they are redirected to the subscription checkout page.<br>
        <br>
        The extension is installed directly from the Chrome/Edge Web Store by clicking the “Add” button. <br>
        Once installed, the extension runs inside the user’s browser and displays live stock information.<br>
        <br>
        Delivery of Service:<br>
        After payment, users instantly receive unlimited tracking access inside the extension. <br>
        No manual steps are required — the upgrade is automatically applied to the user’s installed extension.<br>
